The process of applying for jobs and internships is not a cakewalk. Managing job applications is a time-consuming process. Due to theÂ referrals and deadlines, the entire procedure can be stressful. Our application allows you to track and manage your job application process, as well as regulate it, without the use of cumbersome Excel spreadsheets.

Our application keeps track of the jobs you've added to your wish list. It also keeps track of the companies you've already applied to and keeps a list of any rejections. Rather than having the user browse each company's site for potential prospects, our application allows the applicant to search for them directly using basic keywords. Any prospective work offers can then be added to the applicant's wishlist.

## New Features
### Chrome Extension
Using our Chrome Extension you can now directly fill out your applications using your data from your profile here.
1. Saves time when filling out multiple applications
2. Data can be pulled from multiple profiles if you have different data for different applications
3. Works on multiple websites

### Other new features
1. Cover letter overhaul with new routes and testing
2. New frontend modals to support a cleaner UI
3. Increased testing and code coverage throughout
4. Restructuring of tests from a single file to seperate files designated by catagory
5. Allowed for multiple unique profiles

#### Bug fixes
1. Issues with resume feedback taking a long time
2. Issues with database models being incorrect
3. Issues with exceptions not being properly caught

Users can add or update information to their profile, such as their personal information, skills, preferred job locations, and their experience level.

<p align="center"><img width="700" src="./resources/profilepage.png"></p>

## Explanation:

Currently, we have five fundamental items in our project:

1. The SearchPage where users can search about the Job Postings
2. The MatchesPage where users get recommendation about the jobs according to their preferences
3. The ApplicationsPage where users can add and see the position they applied to and can update/delete the the information. Any details in any table can be modified at any time during the process
4. The ProfilePage where user can add his skills, experience level and preffered location. This information is used to recommend user jobs that require similar skillsets
5. The ManageResumePage where users can upload resumes and get automated LLM-powered feedback, as well as cover letter generation tailored to any job description.

    _(note: Although supporting Qwen2.5:1.5b doesn't require a GPU, it still occupies lots of memory when running locally, so be sure to minimize other processes for optimal performance)_

## Hosting the Database:

### Local MongoDB:

1. Download [MongoDB Community Server](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2. Follow the [Installion Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/server/install/)
3. In app.py set 'host' string to 'localhost'
4. Run the local database:

mongodb

- Recommended: Use a GUI such as [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/download/) to more easily interact with the database

### Hosted database with MongoDB Atlas (RECOMMENDED):

1. [Create account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register) for MongoDB

- **If current MongoDB Atlas owner adds your username/password to the cluster, skip to step 4** \*

2. Follow MongoDB Atlas [Setup Guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) to create a database collection for hosting applications
3. Create application.yml in the backend folder with the following content:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID : <Oauth Google ID>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET : <Oauth Google Secret>
   CONF_URL : https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
   SECRET_KEY : <Any Secret You Want>
   USERNAME : <MongoDB Atlas Username>
   PASSWORD : <MongoDB Atlas Password>
   CLUSTER_URL : <MongoDB Cluster URL>
   ```
4. In app.py set 'host' string to your MongoDB Atlas connection string. Replace the username and password with {username} and {password} respectively
5. For testing through CI to function as expected, repository secrets will need to be added through the settings. Create individual secrets with the following keys/values:

MONGO_USER: <MongoDB Atlas cluster username>
MONGO_PASS: <MongoDB Atlas cluster password>
